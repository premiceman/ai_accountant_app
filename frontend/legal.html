          </ol>

          <h5>4. Professional, Tax & Investment Disclaimers</h5>
          <div class="callout">
            The Service provides informational tools and automation only. <strong>We are not providing tax, accounting, legal, investment, or financial advice</strong>, do not act as your accountant, tax agent, or fiduciary, and do not file, submit, or pay taxes on your behalf. Outputs may be incomplete or inaccurate. You must seek advice from appropriately qualified professionals and verify all outputs before relying on them.
          </div>

          <h5>5. Acceptable Use</h5>
          <p>Your use must comply with our <a href="#aup">Acceptable Use Policy</a>. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or the AUP.</p>

          <h5>6. Beta & AI Features</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Experimental.</strong> Some features (including AI-generated outputs) are experimental, provided “as is”, and may change, break, or be withdrawn.</li>
            <li><strong>Human review required.</strong> You are responsible for reviewing AI outputs and ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
          </ol>

          <h5>7. Third-Party Services</h5>
          <p>The Service may interoperate with third-party products (e.g., storage, payment, analytics). We are not responsible for third-party services; their terms govern your use of them.</p>

          <h5>8. Intellectual Property</h5>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Ours.</strong> We and our licensors retain all rights in the Service and related IP. No rights are granted except as expressly stated.</li>
            <li><strong>Yours.</strong> See Section 3 for rights you grant us to operate the Service.</li>
          </ol>

          <h5>9. Warranties & Disclaimers</h5>
          <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Service is provided <strong>“as is” and “as available”</strong> without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including warranties of accuracy, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and that use of the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>

          <h5>10. Limitation of Liability</h5>
          <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for loss of profits, revenues, savings, business, goodwill, data, or use, even if advised of the possibility. Our aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Service shall not exceed the <strong>greater of £100 or the amounts paid by you to us for the Service in the 12 months</strong> before the event giving rise to liability. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits liability that cannot legally be excluded (e.g., fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or death/personal injury caused by negligence).</p>

          <h5>11. Indemnity</h5>
          <p>You will defend, indemnify, and hold us harmless from and against any claims, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from or relating to (a) your content; (b) your use of the Service in breach of these Terms or applicable law; or (c) your violation of rights of a third party.</p>

          <h5>12. Suspension & Termination</h5>
          <p>We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms, the AUP, or if needed to protect the Service, users, or comply with law. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends.</p>

          <h5>13. Changes to the Service or Terms</h5>
          <p>We may modify the Service and these Terms. If changes are material, we will provide reasonable notice (e.g., in-app or email). Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance.</p>

          <h5>14. Governing Law & Disputes</h5>
          <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>England and Wales</strong> (without regard to conflicts of law). The courts of England and Wales have exclusive jurisdiction, except that consumers resident in the UK/EU may have mandatory rights to bring claims in their home forum.</p>
